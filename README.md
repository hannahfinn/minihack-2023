# BU Spark! Minihack 2023

Achieved the title of Overall Best Hack at BU Spark!'s Mini-Hackathon. Collaborated with a team of six to develop a sustainability-focused project addressing food waste and carbon emissions. In the given timeframe, we conceptualized and developed a prototype app seamlessly integrated with Boston University Grubhub. This innovative solution empowers students to order food for delivery through fellow students, reducing reliance on car delivery services. Additionally, our app enables users to sell excess food they cannot pick up, contributing to a reduction in daily discarded meals. 
Leveraging Figma, we designed the application mockup, while utilizing HTML and CSS to create the website version of the app.
